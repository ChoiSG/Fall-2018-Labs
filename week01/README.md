## Week 1: Introduction to Linux
1. `cd week01`
2. `docker compose up -d`
3. `ssh ritsec@localhost -p12345 (password is ritsec)`

#### Hints:
Easy 1: Where are system usernames stored?
Easy 2: hackerman1337 is hiding the flag in his home directory!
Medium 1: I wish I could find my flag... (format is flag.txt)
Medium 2: Login as the hard user! Some lazy sysadmin forget to clear their history...
Hard: What's in hard.txt?
